# Tic-Tac-Toe
### From this project, I learned
- Integration between different python files and classes.
- Python's unitest.
- Minimax AI concept.
- Minimax AI application on a game.

This is a tic-tac-toe python game.

By running the player file, the user will be prompted to chose a kind of class for Player 1 and Player 2. Pressing (h) will allow the user to input data
and play, while choosing (m) will make that player become an unbeatable AI.

The game follows the basic rules of tic-tac-toe. Player 1 will always be X, and Player 2 will always be O. Player 1 always begins the game.
